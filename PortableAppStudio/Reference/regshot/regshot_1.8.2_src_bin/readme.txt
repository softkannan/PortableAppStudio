-----------------
Introduction:
-----------------
Regshot is a small,free and open-source registry compare utility that allows you to quickly 
take a snapshot of your registry and then compare it with a second one - done after doing 
system changes or installing a new software product. The changes report can be produced in 
text or HTML format and contains a list of all modifications that have taken place between 
snapshot1 and snapshot2. In addition, you can also specify folders (with sub filders) to be 
scanned for changes as well. 
(Most of above text was copied from webattack.com,thanks :)
